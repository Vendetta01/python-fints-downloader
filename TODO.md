# TODO

* [ ] fints: get_scheduled_debits
* [ ] Add tests
* [ ] Write correct MT535-Parser: Collapsing of multilines are a bit more complicated because free text fields have line numbers in front of each line (except the first)
* [ ] Save client/dialog/tan data in db an "lock" accounts that are logged in for other connection attempts

* [X] Split models.py into individual files
* [ ] Menu: sub menu entries should be indented
